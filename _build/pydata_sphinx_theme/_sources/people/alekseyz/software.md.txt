## MaSuRCA genome assembler

[MaSuRCA](http://github.com/alekseyzimin/masurca/) is a high quality assembly
software for Illumina only or hybrid Illumina + PacBio/Oxford Nanopore data
sets. It is capable of producing asemblies of very large and complex genomes
such as 22Gbp genome of Loblolly pine or 16 Gbp genome of bread wheat.\
POLCA polisher and SAMBA scaffolder are distributed with MaSuRCA assembler.

## MUMmer4

[MUMmer4](https://mummer4.github.io/) is a substantially improved version of
popular MUMmer3 software that addresses input sequence size constraints present
in MUMmer3 by changing the 32-bit suffix tree data structure at the core of
MUMmer to a 48-bit suffix array, and that offers improved speed through parallel
processing of input query sequences. With a theoretical limit on the input size
of 141Tbp, MUMmer4 can now work with input sequences of any biologically
realistic length.

## EviAnn automated eukaryotic genome annotation software

[EviAnn (Evidence Annotation)](http://github.com/alekseyzimin/EviAnn_release/)
is a novel annotation software. EviAnn does not use any de novo gene finders in
its processing. It is purely evidence-based. EviAnn uses RNAseq data and/or
transcripts, and proteins from related species as inputs. EviAnn produces
annotation of protein coding genes and transcripts, and outputs it in GFF3
format. EviAnn does not require genome repeats to be soft-masked prior to
running annotation. EviAnn is stable and fast. Annotation of A.thaliana genome
takes about 2 hours on a single 32-64 core server (not including time for
aligning RNAseq reads, which could vary depending on the amount of data used.)

## KrakenUniq

I am not the original author of KrakenUniq. I helped with developing version
0.7.0 and onward. I currently maintain the code to fix bugs and make small
improvements. The new versions allow KrakenUniq to run on standard laptops and
desktops with as little as 16GB of RAM using the --preload-size option.

[KrakenUniq](https://github.com/fbreitwieser/krakenuniq) (formerly KrakenHLL) is
a novel metagenomics classifier that combines the fast k-mer-based
classification of Kraken with an efficient algorithm for assessing the coverage
of unique k-mers found in each species in a dataset. On various test datasets,
KrakenUniq gives better recall and precision than other methods and effectively
classifies and distinguishes pathogens with low abundance from false positives
in infectious disease samples. By using the probabilistic cardinality estimator
HyperLogLog, KrakenUniq runs as fast as Kraken and requires little additional
memory.
